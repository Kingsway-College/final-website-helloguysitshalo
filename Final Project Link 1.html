        Earthquakes
    </h1>
    <h2 >
        An earthquake is caused by movement and interaction of teconic plates. The Earth's lithosphere which is the rigid outer layer, is broken into several large and small pieces called tectonic plates. These plates are constanly moving, very slowly, driven by convection currents in the Earth's mantle which is the layer beneath the lithosphere. When plates collide, pull apart, or slide past each other, they build up stress along their boundaries. This stress can accumulate over  time until it exceeds the strength of the rocks, causing a sudden rupture. This rupture releases energy in the form of seismic waves, which radiate outward from the point of rapture and causes the ground too shake - that's an Earthquake!

 <ul>
    <li>
        <p>
            Convergent boundaries are plates that collide, resulting in subduction (one plate sliding under the other) or mountains building. These boundaries often produce the strongest earthquakes.

            Divergent boundaries are plates that move apart, creating new crust. Earthquakes here are generally less powerful.

            Transform boundaries are plates that slide past eachother horizontally. The San Andreas Fault is a famous example of a transform boundry, and its responsible for many earthquakes in California.

These uncontrolled fires can occur in forests, grasslands, and even urban areas, often exacerbated by dry conditions,high temperatures, and strong winds. They can lead to loss of life, damage to homes and infrastructure, and long term environmental consequences, such as soil erosion, loss of biodiversity, and altered landscapes.

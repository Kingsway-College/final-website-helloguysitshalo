        There are different kinds of plates that produce earthquakes. 
    </p>
    <p>Such as: 
    </p>
      <ul>Convergent boundaries are plates that collide, resulting in subduction (one plate sliding  under the other) or mountain building. These boundaries often produce the strongest earthquakes.
      </ul>
     <ul>
        Divergent boundaries are plates that move apart, creating new crust. Earthquakes here are generally less powerful.
     </ul>
      <ul> 
        Transform boundaries are plates that slide past each other horizonally. The San Andreas Fault is a famous example of a transform boundry, and it's responsible for many earthquakes in California.
    </ul>

A tsunamis is a series of large waves generated by the displacement of a large volume of water, typically caused by underwater earthquakes,or landslides. These waves can travel at incredible speeds across the ocean, and when they reach shallower coastal waters, their height increases dramatically, leading to devasting inundation or destruction.
